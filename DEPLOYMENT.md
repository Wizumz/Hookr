# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

This repository is now configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Automatic Setup Completed ✅

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that automatically builds and deploys the site when changes are pushed to main, master, or the current branch.

2. **Static Site Ready**: The project is already configured as a static site using CDN-based React, which is perfect for GitHub Pages.

## Manual Steps Required in GitHub Repository Settings

To complete the GitHub Pages deployment, you need to:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to https://github.com/Wizumz/Hookr/settings/pages

2. **Configure Pages Source**:
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - This tells GitHub to use the workflow we created instead of trying to build from a branch

3. **Deployment Branch** ✅:
   - The deployment workflow has been merged into the main branch
   - Future deployments will automatically trigger on pushes to main

## Expected Deployment URL

Once configured, your site will be available at:
**https://wizumz.github.io/Hookr/**

## How It Works

- The workflow triggers on pushes to the main branch
- It uploads the entire repository as a static site artifact
- GitHub Pages serves the `index.html` file and all assets
- No build process is needed since you're using CDN-based React

## Monitoring Deployments

- Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor deployment status
- Each push will trigger a new deployment automatically
- Deployments typically take 1-3 minutes to complete

## Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't load properly:
1. Check that all file paths in `index.html` are relative (they are ✅)
2. Ensure the GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check the Actions tab for any deployment errors

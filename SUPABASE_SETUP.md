# 🗄️ RipRap Supabase Integration Setup

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to set up Supabase backend for RipRap's fishing community.

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. **Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard)**
2. **Sign in/Sign up** with GitHub (recommended)
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Fill in project details:**
   - Organization: Choose or create one
   - Project Name: `RipRap Fishing Community` 
   - Database Password: Generate a strong password (save this!)
   - Region: Choose closest to your users
5. **Click "Create new project"**
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for project to initialize

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

1. **In your Supabase dashboard**, go to `Settings > API`
2. **Copy these values:**
   - **URL**: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`
   - **anon/public key**: `eyJhbGci...` (long string)

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env` file** in your project root:
   ```bash
   # In /workspace/.env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   ```

2. **Replace the values** with your actual credentials from Step 2

### Step 4: Create Database Schema

1. **In Supabase dashboard**, go to `SQL Editor`
2. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `database-schema.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** to execute the SQL
4. **Verify tables created** in `Table Editor`

You should see these tables:
- ✅ `posts` - User posts with location data
- ✅ `comments` - Comments on posts  
- ✅ `votes` - User votes (upvote/downvote)
- ✅ `reports` - Content moderation reports

### Step 5: Enable Real-time

1. **Go to `Database > Replication`**
2. **Turn on replication** for these tables:
   - ✅ `posts`
   - ✅ `comments` 
   - ✅ `votes`

### Step 6: Test the Integration

1. **Build and run** your app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for any Supabase connection errors
3. **Try creating a post** - it should appear in Supabase `posts` table
4. **Try voting/commenting** - should update in real-time

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Database Features Enabled

✅ **PostGIS Extension** - For location-based queries  
✅ **Row Level Security** - Anonymous access with policies  
✅ **Real-time Subscriptions** - Live updates for posts/comments  
✅ **Automatic Triggers** - Vote counting and post visibility  
✅ **Geographic Indexing** - Fast location queries  

### Security & Privacy

- **Anonymous Access**: No user registration required
- **Device-based Voting**: Uses local device ID for vote tracking
- **Location Privacy**: Only approximate locations stored
- **Content Moderation**: Built-in reporting system
- **Auto-hiding**: Posts with -5 votes automatically hidden

### Performance Optimizations

- **Geographic Indexes**: Fast "nearby posts" queries
- **Vote Count Caching**: Real-time vote tallies
- **Comment Count Caching**: Instant comment counters
- **Distance Calculation**: Server-side for accuracy

## 🎣 How It Works

### Anonymous Community
```
User Device → Local Identity → Supabase Posts
     ↓              ↓              ↓
Device ID → Screen Name → Shared Posts
```

### Location-Based Feed
```
User Location → Supabase Function → Nearby Posts
(lat, lng, 5mi) → get_nearby_posts() → Real-time Feed
```

### Real-time Updates
```
New Post → Supabase Trigger → Real-time Channel → UI Update
Vote Cast → Update Count → Live Subscription → Instant UI
```
